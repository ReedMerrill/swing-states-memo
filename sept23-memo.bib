  abstract = {One of the most important developments affecting electoral competition in the United States has been the increasingly partisan behavior of the American electorate. Yet more voters than ever claim to be independents. We argue that the explanation for these seemingly contradictory trends is the rise of negative partisanship. Using data from the American National Election Studies, we show that as partisan identities have become more closely aligned with social, cultural and ideological divisions in American society, party supporters including leaning independents have developed increasingly negative feelings about the opposing party and its candidates. This has led to dramatic increases in party loyalty and straight-ticket voting, a steep decline in the advantage of incumbency and growing consistency between the results of presidential elections and the results of House, Senate and even state legislative elections. The rise of negative partisanship has had profound consequences for electoral competition, democratic representation and governance.},

  abstract = {The development of Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) has allowed scholars to more accurately estimate subnational public opinion using national polls. However, MRP generally fails to recover reliable estimates from polls whose respondents are selected using cluster sampling\textemdash also called area-probability sampling. This is in part because cluster-sampled polls rely on a complex form of random sampling focused on national representativeness that may result in small or unrepresentative subsamples in subnational geographies. This has limited MRP's usefulness in subnational opinion estimation in several contexts, including historical polls in the United States, where cluster-sampling was common into the 1980s, and large academic studies in many countries today. In this paper, I test two approaches to improve estimation from MRP with cluster-sampled polls. The first is pooling data from multiple surveys to produce a larger sample of clusters. The second is Clustered MRP (CMRP), which extends MRP by modeling opinion using the geographic information included in a survey's cluster-sampling procedure. Using simulations, I show that both methods improve upon traditional MRP, and I validate them using historical polls in the United States.},

However, innovations in nonparametric regularization methods can further improve the researcher's ability to extrapolate opinion data to a geographic unit of interest. I test an ensemble of regularization algorithms and find that there is room for substantial improvement on the multilevel model via more flexible methods of regularization. I propose a modified version of MRP that replaces the multilevel model with a nonparametric approach called Bayesian additive regression trees (BART or, when combined with post-stratification, BARP). I compare both methods across a number of data contexts, demonstrating the benefits of applying more powerful regularization methods to extrapolate opinion data to target geographical units. I provide an R package that implements the BARP method.},

  abstract = {Multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) is a popular use of hierarchical models in political science. Multiple papers have suggested that relying on machine learning methods can provide substantially better performance than traditional approaches that use hierarchical models. However, these comparisons are often unfair to traditional techniques as they omit possibly important interactions or nonlinear effects. I show that complex (``deep'') hierarchical models that include interactions can nearly match or outperform state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Combining multiple models into an ensemble can improve performance, although deep hierarchical models are themselves given considerable weight in these ensembles. The main limitation to using deep hierarchical models is speed. This paper derives new techniques to further accelerate estimation using variational approximations. I provide software that uses weakly informative priors and can estimate nonlinear effects using splines. This allows flexible and complex hierarchical models to be fit as quickly as many comparable machine learning techniques.},

Although a long-standing research tradition claims that elections are effective tools for the sanctioning and selection of leaders, a more recent literature argues that voters often reward and punish incumbents for ``irrelevant events.'' The empirical literature on this topic is characterized by conflicting findings. Drawing on ideas from the open science movement, and showing how they can advance the transparency of observational research, we replicated three prominent studies on irrelevant events and voting behavior: (1) Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels's 2016 study of droughts and floods; (2) Andrew Healy, Neil Malhotra, and Cecilia Hyunjung Mo's 2010 study of college football; and (3) Andrew Healy and Neil Malhotra's 2010 study of tornadoes. Each study replicates well in some areas and poorly in others. Had we sought to debunk any of the three with ex post specification searches, we could have done so. However, our approach required us to see the full, complicated picture.},

We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship so that scholars can distinguish between general and partisan responsiveness. We use this to study responsiveness in the context of Senate confirmation votes on Supreme Court nominees. We find that senators weight their partisan base far more heavily when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter. This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness and the role of public opinion in shaping the members of the nation's highest court. The methodological approach we develop enables more nuanced analyses of public opinion and its effects, as well as more finely grained studies of legislative behavior and policy making.},

I find that patterns of dynamism and heterogeneity vary. State opinion on some issues, such as consumer sentiment, is highly dynamic but follow closely with national trends. On other issues, such as education spending, states exhibit more stability with heterogeneous trends. And still other issues, such as abortion, exhibit both stability and homogeneity. The results have implications for longstanding debates concerning the nature and origins of mass opinion, the way that state opinions are translated into policies, and how to measure state opinion. Finally, the extensive data set of longitudinal state opinion is publicly available.},

We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes. The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science.

Statistical models that estimate the spatial locations of individual decision-makers have made a key contribution to this success. Spatial models have been estimated for the U.S. Congress, the Supreme Court, U.S. presidents, a large number of non-U.S. legislatures, and supranational organizations. Yet one potentially fruitful laboratory for testing spatial theories, the individual U.S. states, has remained relatively unexploited, for two reasons. First, state legislative roll call data have not yet been systematically collected for all states over time. Second, because ideal point models are based on latent scales, comparisons of ideal points across states or even between chambers within a state are difficult. This article reports substantial progress on both fronts. First, we have obtained the roll call voting data for all state legislatures from the mid-1990s onward. Second, we exploit a recurring survey of state legislative candidates to allow comparisons across time, chambers, and states as well as with the U.S. Congress. The resulting mapping of America's state legislatures has great potential to address numerous questions not only about state politics and policymaking, but also about legislative politics in general.},

BART is a Bayesian nonparametric, machine learning, ensemble predictive modeling method for continuous, binary, categorical and time-to-event outcomes. Furthermore, BART is a tree-based, black-box method which fits the outcome to an arbitrary random function, f , of the covariates. The BART technique is relatively computationally efficient as compared to its competitors, but large sample sizes can be demanding. Therefore, the BART package includes efficient state-of-the-art implementations for continuous, binary, categorical and time-to-event outcomes that can take advantage of modern off-the-shelf hardware and software multi-threading technology. The BART package is written in C++ for both programmer and execution efficiency. The BART package takes advantage of multi-threading via forking as provided by the parallel package and OpenMP when available and supported by the platform. The ensemble of binary trees produced by a BART fit can be stored and re-used later via the R predict function. In addition to being an R package, the installed BART routines can be called directly from C++. The BART package provides the tools for your BART toolbox.},
