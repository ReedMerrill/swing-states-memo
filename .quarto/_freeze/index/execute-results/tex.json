As a given state's legislative branch becomes more polarized, the state is more likely to swing in presidential elections.\n\n#### Competing Hypotheses -- Partisanship\n\n2. As the proportion of a state's voters identifying as true independents increases, the state is more likely to swing in presidential elections. \n3. As a state's two-party make-up shifts towards equal proportions for both parties, the state is more likely to swing in presidential elections.\n\n#### Causal Drivers:\n\n- elite polarization\n- Partisan realignment: attitudinal change, migration, birth rates\n\n# Estimating Partisan Identification at the State Level\n\nWe will estimate our state-level partisanship variable using Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) within a Bayesian framework [@pacheco2011Using, @gelmanChapter, @goplerud2023ReEvaluating, @buttice2013How]. To perform MRP, we need two types of data: demographic population data, and polling data. The polling data is used to fit a multinomial logistic model that estimates the individual-level probability of a given respondent identifying as a Democrat, Republican, or Independent. The administrative data is then used to create a poststratification frame, which is essentially a joint distribution of individual-level demographics that are parsed out by geographic unit(s) such as counties or states.[^1] Each row of this distribution can be thought of as a demographic profile that exists in the population for a given geography. The frequencies of these profiles in the geographic level of interest can then be used to predict weighted probabilities of each profile identifying as a Democrat, Republican, or Independent in each state, which can then be aggregated to any available geographic level to obtain proportions of those identifying with each party.\n\nThis approach aligns well with our broader project for a few reasons. Most importantly, the multilevel model allows for the pooling information across levels of the variables, which is especially useful when estimating states with small sample sizes. The multilevel model also allows us to make reasonable predictions of partisan identification for geographies that were not sampled in the available polling data for one or more years of interest. This is because in a multilevel framework we compute means at every level of analysis, which allows us to incorporate information about a state's region and other characteristics in our estimates.\n\nThe above explanation is the standard MRP implementation for estimating state-level opinion for a single year. Because we are interested in generating partisanship estimates for several years, some modifications to the above framework are necessary. Luckily, the longitudinal nature of our question can be used to our advantage when it comes to generating optimal partisanship estimates. If we combine all available polling data across years into a single dataset and estimate the model with varying year intercepts then information will also be shared across geographies in all years of the analysis, which provides additional robustness to our estimates. \n\nAnother stumbling block for estimating state-level partisanship is that the available polling data is usually area-cluster sampled, which means that they are likely not representative of the individual state populations being studied. TIn many recent years, the American National Election Study has used simple random sampling to obtain a portion of its overall sample, which mitigates this issue to an extent. However, it has been proposed that the problem could be further addressed by accounting for the sampling design of area-clustered samples in the predictive model itself (@stollwerkEssays). This is achieved by including random effects for the geographic units that were used in area clustered sampling when survey data was collected. The resulting partial pooling of information across geographies smaller than the state will improve all of our estimates because it will provide information about a state that would be otherwise missing for any given year by borrowing means generated within that state from other years during prediciton. The extent to which this approach can be implemented depends upon the available polling and demographic data.\n\n[^1]: The weighting process is also greatly improved by the incluion of state-level predictors, such as the state's region, previous electoral returns, and so on. This are included in the model as fixed effects, and must also be included in the poststratification frames in order for predictions to be possible.\n\n## Available Data\n\n### Publicly Available Registration Data\n\nOne good source of data would be the publicly registration data, however some states don't report the partisanship of their registered voters, and the data becomes more sparse the further back in time we go. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/registration-data-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Existing Estimates\n\n### Cooperative Congressional Election Study\n\n## Methodology\n\n## Preliminary Results\n\n\n# Summary\n\n## To do\n\n- Operationalizing \"swinginess\"\n\n",
