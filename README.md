This is a project memo concerning MRP estimation of state-level partisan identification in the United States. The project is unique in that it estimates Republican, Democrat, and true Independent means. It also covers a significant time-span, ranging from 1996 to the present and providing an estimate for every presidential election year. It also incorporates independent leaners by coding them as partisans dring the individual-level predictive modeling stage.
