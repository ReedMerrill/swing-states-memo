    "text": "Available Data\n\nPolling Data\nBecause our main and perhaps only consistent source of polling data is the ANES data we have obtained access to, it would be helpful to combine the ANES with other polls. This section discusses the available polling data and its limitations.\n\nExisting Estimates\nPacheco (2014) provides poll-based estimates for the proportion of Democrat identifiers out of all partisans (Republicans Democrats, and Independents) for 1978 to 2010. These estimates are primarily based on CBS/NYT polls. They utilize an older and less accurate approach to MRP that does not utilize multiple deep interactions when specifying the multilevel model (called “deep MRP”) (see Goplerud 2023), and they don’t account for the sampling design of the polls (Auslen 2023; Stollwerk n.d.), making them of limited use for our purposes.\n\n\nCooperative Congressional Election Study\n\nLarge sample size and an approximately simple random sample make it very reliable\n\nMRP provides little improvement over simple mean estimates of state level public opinion (Gelman n.d.)\nonly available for 2006 to 2020\nBecause sub-state geographies aren’t included, something would need to be done before combining this data with our ANES data where we have sub-state geographies\n\n\n\n\nOther Sources\n\nThe General Social Survey\n\nexcellent temporal coverage for its partisanship variable, going back to 1974\nDoesn’t include state of residence by default\nDoesn’t have a question that parses partisan leaners out of the independent category\nApplying for restricted data access so we can use geocodes is an option\n\nNationscape data appears to be very promising for geographic coverage, but it only began being collected in 2016.\nRoper Center for Public Opinion Research’s iPoll database of polls.\n\nMany of these are by news agencies\nquestion wordings vary from those in the ANES, and I haven’t come across leaners being parsed out anywhere in this database\nThe problem of not having substate geographies is present\n\n\n\n\nPolling Data Summary\nBesides the ANES, polls are sparse and most comparable data is only readily available for recent years. This is a concern because, if the needed data were available, one benefit of adding additional polls is a more geographic diversity within states and less missing data at the state level. Because we can’t add additional data for the earlier half of our time-series where we need it the most, the utility of adding additional polls is limited. Another concern is the overall balance of the data. If we add additional polls for later years we risk artificially inflating their sample sizes and weighting all model estimates towards the means for later years. Because data is mostly missing or insufficient in the earlier years wher we need it most, it is possible that we will obtain better results by using the ANES data alone.\n\n\n\nPublicly Available Registration Data\nOne good source of data would be the publicly registration data, however some states don’t report the partisanship of their registered voters, and the data becomes more sparse the further back in time we go. Figure 1 shows the missingness of the registration data by state and year. Each “row” in the graph represents one state in a given year (1988 to 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic Data\nThe availability of census-based demographic data also affects the type of partisanship model we can specify. The table below summarizes the census-based data that is available.\n\n\n\nSummary of Census-based Data availability\n\n\nSource\nDemographics\nCounties\nCensus Tract\n\n\n\n\n1980 Decennial\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n1990 Decennial\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2000 Decennial\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2010 Decennial\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n2020 Decennial\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n2008 ACS\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n2012 ACS\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2016 ACS\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2020 ACS\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demographic variables we need so we can generate a joint distributions for poststratifying (age, race, sex, educational attainment) are available in the 1980, 1990, and 2000 but not the 2010 or 2020 decennial censuses, likely because the American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long-form census in 2010. One joint distribution is needed for each year of polling data we have, which will match presidential election years. Breakdowns of these demographics by geographies smaller than the state are available in all of the decennial censuses, and Google Cloud provides complete breakdowns of these demographics by state, county, and census tract for the ACS. Because of the limitations in the census-based data, it seems best to use decennial censuses for the earlier years and the ACS for the years it is available. For earlier years it will be necessary to interpollate new distributions for the years in between the decennial censuses, as Kastellec et al. (2015) did. Interpolation is also needed for the years between 2000 and 2010, where we would have to use the 2000 decennial census and the 2010 ACS. For years falling between 2010 to 2020 or we could use the ACS without interpolation because it is available for every year in that range, or interpollate for the sake of consistency."
